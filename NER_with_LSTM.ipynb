In this assignment, you will train a named entity recognition system that could be trained in a few seconds (on a GPU) and will get around 75% accuracy. Then, you will load in the exact version of your model, which was trained for a longer period of time. You could then evaluate the trained version of your model to get 96% accuracy! Finally, you will be able to test your named entity recognition system with your own sentence."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# mount your drive\n","from google.colab import

It returns the next item in a pre-defined sequence. Here is a [link](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) to review python generators. \n","\n","In many AI applications it is very useful to have a data generator. You will now implement a data generator for our NER application.\n","\n","<a name=\"ex01\"></a>\n","### Exercise 01\n","\n","**Instructions:** Implement a data generator function that takes in `batch_size, x, y, pad, shuffle` where $x$ is a large list of sentences, and $y$ is a list of the tags associated with those sentences and pad is a pad value. Return a subset of those inputs in a tuple of two arrays `(X,Y)`. \n","\n","`X` and `Y` are arrays of dimension (`batch_size, max_len`), where `max_len` is the length of the longest sentence *in that batch*. You will pad the `X` and `Y` examples with the pad argument. If `shuffle=True`, the data will be traversed in a random order.\n","\n","**Details:**\n","\n","Use this code as an outer loop\n","```\n","while True:  \n","...  \n","yield((X,Y))  \n","```\n","\n","so your data generator runs continuously. Within that loop, define two `for` loops:  \n","\n","1. The first stores temporal lists of the data samples to be included in the batch, and finds the maximum length of the sentences contained in it.\n","\n","2. The second one moves the elements from the temporal list into NumPy arrays pre-filled with pad values.\n","\n","There are three features useful for defining this generator:\n","\n","1. The NumPy `full` function to fill the NumPy arrays with a pad value. See [full function documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.full.html).\n","\n","2. Tracking the current location in the incoming lists of sentences. Generators variables hold their values between invocations, so we create an `index` variable, initialize to zero, and increment by one for each sample included in a batch. However, we do not use the `index` to access the positions of the list of sentences directly. Instead, we use it to select one index from a list of indexes. In this way, we can change the order in which we traverse our original list, keeping untouched our original list.  \n","\n","3. Since `batch_size` and the length of the input lists are not aligned, gathering a batch_size group of inputs may involve wrapping back to the beginning of the input loop. In our approach, it is just enough to reset the `index` to 0. We can re-shuffle the list of indexes to produce different batches each time."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"id":"4db5a631","metadata":{"id":"4db5a631","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670254125038,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":223,"user":{"displayName":"Ashraf Kasem","userId":"09309100295203671464"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# UNQ_C1 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)\n","# GRADED FUNCTION: data_generator\n","def data_generator(batch_size, x, y, pad, shuffle=False, verbose=False):\n","    '''\n","      Input: \n","        batch_size - integer describing the batch size\n","        x - list containing sentences where words are represented as integers\n","        y - list containing tags associated with the sentences\n","        shuffle - Shuffle the data order\n","        pad - an integer representing a pad character\n","        verbose - Print information during runtime\n","      Output:\n","        a tuple containing 2 elements:\n","        X - np.ndarray of dim (batch_size, max_len) of padded sentences\n","        Y - np.ndarray of dim (batch_size, max_len) of tags associated with the sentences in X\n","    '''\n","    \n","    # count the number of lines in data_lines\n","    num_lines = len(x)\n","    \n","    # create an array with the indexes of data_lines that can be shuffled\n","    lines_index = [*range(num_lines)]\n","    \n","    # shuffle the indexes if shuffle is set to True\n","    if shuffle:\n","        rnd.shuffle(lines_index)\n","    \n","    index = 0 # tracks current location in x, y\n","    while True:\n","        buffer_x = [0] * batch_size # Temporal array to store the raw x data for this batch\n","        buffer_y = [0] * batch_size # Temporal array to store the raw y data for this batch\n","                \n","  ### START CODE HERE (Replace instances of 'None' with your code) ###\n","        \n","        # Copy into the temporal buffers the sentences in x[index] \n","        # along with their corresponding labels y[index]\n","        # Find maximum length of sentences in x[index] for this batch. \n","        # Reset the index if we reach the end of the data set, and shuffle the indexes if needed.\n","        max_len = 0 \n","        for i in range(batch_size):\n","             # if the index is greater than or equal to the number of lines in x\n","            if index >= num_lines:\n","                # then reset the index to 0\n","                index = 0\n","                # re-shuffle the indexes if shuffle is set to True\n","                if shuffle:\n","                    rnd.shuffle(lines_index)\n","            \n","            # The current position is obtained using `lines_index[index]`\n","            # Store the x value at the current position into the buffer_x\n","            buffer_x[i] = x[lines_index[index]]\n","            \n","            # Store the y value at the current position into the buffer_y\n","            buffer_y[i] = y[lines_index[index]]\n","            \n","            lenx = len(x[lines_index[index]]) #length of current x[]\n","            if lenx > max_len:\n","                max_len = lenx #max_len tracks longest x[]\n","            \n","            # increment index by one\n","            index += 1\n","\n","\n","        # create X,Y, NumPy arrays of size (batch_size, max_len) 'full' of pad value\n","        X = np.full((batch_size, max_len), pad)\n","        Y = np.full((batch_size, max_len), pad)\n","\n","        # copy values from lists to NumPy arrays.
